# Brain-Tumor-Detection-CNN
This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. Trained on medical imaging data, the model learns to differentiate between normal and tumor-affected scans. Using deep learning techniques, it enhances diagnostic accuracy, assisting medical professionals in identifying brain tumors more efficiently
